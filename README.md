# Resources for learning in vivo electrophysiology

## Implementation / Recordings

+ [Dr. Luke Sjulson's methods class](https://github.com/SjulsonLab/methods_class) - excellent resource for learning all about in vivo ephys recordings and other cutting edge neuroscience techniques. Also contains an entire lecture on spike sorting.

+ [The Axon Guide](https://mdc.custhelp.com/euf/assets/content/Axon%20Guide%203rd%20edition.pdf) - a biophysical guide for ephys with a focus on in vitro slice recordings
